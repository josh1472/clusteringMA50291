### Overview
This package provides various clustering algorithms to analyze and group data points based on their similarities. It includes implementations of popular clustering techniques such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.

### Installation
To install the package, use the following command:
```bash
pip install clusteringMA50291
```

### Usage
Here is a basic example of how to use the package:

```python
from clusteringMA50291 import KMeans

# Sample data
data = [[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0], [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]]

# Create a KMeans instance
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)

# Fit the model
kmeans.fit(data)

# Predict the clusters
labels = kmeans.predict(data)
print(labels)
```
