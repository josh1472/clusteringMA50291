# Pupil Clustering Analysis

This Python project reads a CSV file containing height and weight data for pupils, calculates basic statistics, performs K-means clustering, and visualizes the clusters. The results are saved as PNG plots and exported to separate CSV files for each cluster.

## Module uses

1. **Statistics**:
   - Calculate and display the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for height and weight.

2. **K-Means Clustering**:
   - Perform clustering with 2, 3, 4, and 5 clusters.
   - Output the cluster centroids and the number of pupils in each cluster.

3. **Plotting**:
   - Generate scatter plots of the clusters, saving each plot as a PNG file.

4. **Export Clusters**:
   - Export the data points in each cluster into separate CSV files.
